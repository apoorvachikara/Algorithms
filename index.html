    <p>When we review these recommendations at the beginning of each tax year, we make some assumptions around your workplace pension, employment situation, and pension carry forward. It's especially important to check these assumptions are correct if you have the following, otherwise our recommendations may not be suitable for you:</p>
    <ul>
       <li>   have an income of more than £175,000 per year</li>
    </ul>
    or
    <ul>
       <li>  think your savings toward retirement could be more than £30,000 this tax year (including any employer contributions and any tax relief)</li> 
    </ul>
    or
    <ul>
       <li>  have an active defined benefit pension</li> 
    </ul>
<p>
    If this applies to you, please call us on 0800 587 0475. Lines are open 9am to 5pm, Monday to Friday
