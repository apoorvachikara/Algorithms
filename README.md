# Algorithms

Algorithms are important when you code not to just show off, but it really solves problems efficiently and effectively. I started this poject to practice different algorithms in Javascript and Typescript. 

I have added a few DS in the repo and tried to create them with a under folder name targeting some interview questions.

It will really help you to get track on DS, I am continuously adding new problems and DS to it
