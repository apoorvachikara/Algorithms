/**
 * Problem Description

   There are N gas stations along a circular route, where the amount of gas at station i is arr[i]. You have a car with an unlimited gas tank and it costs cost[i] of gas to travel from station i to its next station (i+1). At the beginning of the journey, the tank is empty at one of the gas stations.

   Return the minimum starting gas stationâ€™s index if you need to travel around the circuit once, otherwise return -1.

   Problem Note

        - Completing the circuit means starting at i and ending up at i again.
        - Both input arrays are non-empty and have the same length.
        - Each element in the input arrays is a non-negative integer.

    distance = [1,2,3,4,5];
    cost[] = [3,4,5,1,2]
